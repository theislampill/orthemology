  Spinoza, *Ethica* Pars I — Modal layer.

  Possible-world reconstruction of Spinoza's *Ethica* Pars I.
  Bridge axioms link world-relative primitives (`existsAt`,
  `causeAt`) and world-invariant primitives (`conceptualDep`)
  to the base `EthicaWorld` predicates, so the modal layer is
  fully connected to Pars1Axioms / CausalAxioms.

  Design choices
  --------------
  * **No Mathlib dependency** at this layer. Spinoza's modal
    content can be expressed with Lean-core `Prop`-valued
    accessibility relations parameterised by an abstract `World`
    type.
  * **Possible-world semantics, S5-flavoured** with universal
    accessibility (Della Rocca 2008 ch. 2).
  * **Three primitive classes**, each paired with an axioms class:
    - `ModalEthicaWorld Thing World` (data) +
      `ModalEthicaAxioms Thing World` (Prop) for world-relative
      existence and its bridge to `involvesExistence`.
    - `ConceptualStructure Thing` (data) + `ConceptualBridges Thing`
      (Prop) for world-invariant conceptual dependence and its
      bridges to `perSeConceived` / `conceivedThroughAnother`.
    - `ModalCausalWorld Thing World` (data) +
      `ModalCausalAxioms Thing World` (Prop) for world-relative
      causation, A3 substantive, and the bridge to `Cause`.
  * **Della Rocca interpretation explicitly committed**: the
    `World`-invariance of `conceptualDep` and the bridges
    `involvesExistence ↔ ∀ w, existsAt` and `Cause ↔ ∀ w, causeAt`
    are PSR-flavoured. **Bennett-line readers** (who hold conceptual
    dependence is itself revisable across conceptual schemes, or
    who deny the essential-existence ↔ necessary-existence
    biconditional) would need a different layer where these
    primitives are world-relative or independent. The current
    layer is **not Bennett-neutral**; it is the Della-Rocca-line
    formalisation, with the commitment cost made visible at the
    typing surface.

  Diamond inheritance
  -------------------
  Multiple classes (`ConceptualStructure`, `ModalEthicaWorld`,
  `CausalWorld`, `ModalCausalWorld`) extend `EthicaWorld`. When
  constructing a model that needs more than one, share a single
  `EthicaWorld` instance using the `toEthicaWorld := inferInstance`
  pattern:
  ```
  instance : EthicaWorld T := ...
  instance : ConceptualStructure T :=
    { toEthicaWorld := inferInstance, ... }
  instance : ModalEthicaWorld T W :=
    { toEthicaWorld := inferInstance, ... }
  ```
  This avoids the diamond divergence Lean 4's structure inheritance
  does not enforce automatically.

  ## Note on the implementation cost of separation
  -----------------------------------------------

  The four modal-layer structures (`ModalEthicaWorld`,
  `ConceptualStructure`, `ModalCausalWorld`, plus their axiom
  classes) cannot be merged into a single typeclass without
  introducing diamond inheritance from `EthicaWorld`. The
  cost — visible as `@`-application verbosity in cross-structure
  proofs (see `Models/SingleSubstance.lean` examples) — is itself
  **philosophical evidence**: Spinoza's PSR-driven *monism*
  (Della Rocca 2008 ch. 2), under which existence, conception, and
  causation are unified by sufficient reason, **cannot be directly
  expressed in Lean 4's type system**. Bennett 1984 §16's analytic
  decomposition of these concepts into separable claims is what
  Lean *naturally enforces*.

  That is, the engineering separation we were forced to adopt
  (data class + axiom class for each of existence, conception,
  causation) is the mechanical reflection of Bennett's analytic
  reading of Spinoza's modal/conceptual concepts. A genuine
  Della-Rocca formalisation — concepts unified at the type
  level — would need a typeclass mechanism Lean 4 does not
  provide. The engineering cost is not a workaround: it is a
  Bennett-line trace in the formalisation itself.

  Status of the GAP attempts
  --------------------------
  * **GAP-6** (Prop. I priority): scaffolding plus
    `ConceptualBridges` (definitional, Section I) plus
    `ConceptualDepAxioms` (substantive, Section III candidates
    A16/A17). `prop_1_priority` proved as one-line application of
    `ConceptualDepAxioms`. Remaining: derive
    `ConceptualDepAxioms` fields from PSR + base axioms (Della Rocca
    demote attempt). If it fails, A16/A17 stay in Section III on
    the modal layer.
  * **GAP-7** (A3 ontological): `ModalCausalAxioms` provides A3
    substantive in both clauses (necessitation and the
    "no cause → no effect" clause, which is *not* the
    contrapositive — see below). Bridge `Cause ↔ ∀ w, causeAt`
    now lives as a `ModalCausalAxioms` field, so base-layer
    Causation.lean's `Cause` is connected to the modal layer.
  * **A12 / A13 / A14 / A15 demote attempts**: developed below
    (§δ–§δ-4), building on the bridges established here.
  * **GAP-8a (cardinality)**: still requires Mathlib's
    `Set.Infinite` or equivalent; deferred.

/-! ## §δ — Demote attempt for A12 via PSR (Della Rocca route)

  This section commits a Principle-of-Sufficient-Reason axiom for
  substance distinguishability and attempts to **demote** A12
  (`Pars1Axioms.ax_substanceIdByAttribute`, currently a Section
  III commitment) from axiom to theorem.

  ### Setup: PSR for substance distinguishability

  Della Rocca 2008 ch. 2's reading of Spinoza's PSR for substances:
  if two substances are distinct, their distinction has a
  sufficient reason; per Prop. IV the only available reason is an
  attribute difference (modes are posterior, Prop. I priority); so
  distinct substances must differ in some attribute. We commit
  this as a single modal-layer axiom:

  ```
  ∀ s₁ s₂, Substance s₁ → Substance s₂ → s₁ ≠ s₂ →
    ∃ a, (Attribute a s₁ ∧ ¬ Attribute a s₂) ∨
         (Attribute a s₂ ∧ ¬ Attribute a s₁)
  ```

  ### What demotes (partial success)

  With PSR and the base layer, we can derive a **partial** form of
  A12: substances sharing **all** attributes are identical. Proof:
  if distinct, PSR provides a discriminating attribute, contradicting
  shared-all-attributes.

  ### What does **not** demote (the predicted failure)

  Full A12 — substances sharing **any** attribute (one or more) are
  identical — is **strictly stronger**. PSR-distinguishability only
  rules out the case where there is **no** attribute distinguishing
  the two; it does not exclude the case where two substances share
  some attributes but differ on others. The any-shared-attribute
  reading of A12 (Spinoza's "ejusdem naturae sive attributi") goes
  beyond what PSR alone licenses.

  Bennett 1984 §17 makes essentially this point in prose: PSR rules
  out indiscernibles, but Spinoza's Prop. V demands more — that
  even **partial** attribute-sharing forces identity. The
  mechanical finding here is the predicted failure: PSR demotes A12
  partially, not fully. The remaining content of A12 — the strong
  individuation by *each* attribute, Curley / Garrett's strong
  reading of Def. III — must be retained as a separate Section III
  commitment.

  This is the **first mechanical evidence in the project for the
  Bennett line**: a Section III axiom predicted to be irreducible
  to PSR has been confirmed irreducible at the type level.

    `share-all`.

    This theorem demonstrates that A12's content is *partially*
    derivable from PSR. The remaining gap (any-shared-attribute)
    is documented in `A12_full_NOT_demotable`. -/

-- [EthicaWorld T]`, the derivation would yield `False` on this
-- model — but `False` is not provable, hence A12 is not derivable.
-- Bennett 1984 §17 makes this point in prose; the project
-- mechanises it via the counter-model. A `: True := trivial`
-- marker would be Lean-as-rhetoric, proving nothing about
-- provability, so none is used.

end demote_attempt

/-! ## §δ-2 — Demote attempt for A13 via PSR self-causation

  A13 (`Pars1Axioms.ax_substance_involves_existence`) says
  `∀ s, Substance s → involvesExistence s`. Under A18 (modal
  bridge), this is equivalent to
  `∀ s, Substance s → ∀ w, existsAt s w`. We attempt to demote A13
  by introducing a single PSR-flavoured commitment about
  self-causation, then deriving the modal A13 form from it via
  the existing modal infrastructure (A3-first-clause + A18).

  ### The new commitment

  ```
  ax_substance_self_caused_at_every_world :
    ∀ s : Thing, ∀ w : World, Substance s → causeAt s s w
  ```

  Della Rocca 2008 ch. 2's reading: every substance is *causa sui*,
  and this self-causation holds at every possible world (causation
  being essential, world-invariant per A21). The PSR-flavoured
  commitment is "every substance has a sufficient reason for its
  existence, namely itself".

  ### What demotes (full success — but with caveats)

  With the new axiom A23, we can derive
  `Substance s → ∀ w, existsAt s w` directly via A3-first-clause
  (cause at w → effect exists at w). Combined with A18 (bridge to
  base-layer `involvesExistence`), this reproduces A13's content.

  ### Mechanical finding: this is a *modal translation*, not a
  *reduction*

  Unlike A12 — where the partial demote captured strictly less than
  A12's content (review §δ above) — A13 fully demotes here. But the
  philosophical price is that **A23 is not weaker than A13**: it
  asserts substance self-causation at every world, which is the
  modal-form content of A13. The demote is a translation between
  two equivalent expressions of "substance has necessary
  existence", not a derivation from genuinely weaker premises.

  Compare to A12:
  - A12 *partial demote*: PSR delivers only the all-shared-attribute
    case; full A12 is **strictly stronger** than what's delivered.
    Bennett-line evidence for irreducibility.
  - A13 *full demote via translation*: the modal-form A23
    delivers full A13 via existing bridges (A18, A3-first-clause).
    But A23 is itself at the same commitment-strength tier as A13
    — it's a redescription, not a reduction.

  This asymmetry is itself the philosophical content: A12's
  universality clause has no modal equivalent in the available
  vocabulary, while A13's existence clause does have one (via
  modal causation). A12 is **irreducibly substantive**; A13 is
  **modally translatable**.

  Bennett 1984 §17 vs Della Rocca 2008 ch. 2: Bennett's
  irreducibility claim survives intact for A12; for A13, both
  readings can claim partial victory — Della Rocca that A13 is
  "really" the modal A23, Bennett that the commitment hasn't
  decreased in strength.

/-! ## §δ-3 — Demote attempt for A14 via PSR essence-perception

  A14 (`Pars1Axioms.ax_substance_has_attribute`) says
  `∀ s, Substance s → ∃ a, Attribute a s`. The Della Rocca route:
  every substance is intelligible (PSR), and intelligibility is
  mediated by attributes (Def. IV); hence every substance has at
  least one attribute.

  ### The new commitment

  ```
  ax_substance_has_essence_perception :
    ∀ s : Thing, Substance s → ∃ a, intellectPerceivesAsEssence s a
  ```

  ### What demotes (full success — but trivially so)

  Unfolding `Attribute a s := Substance s ∧ intellectPerceivesAsEssence
  s a`, the new axiom delivers A14's content immediately. The proof
  is two lines.

  ### Mechanical finding: A14 is a *trivial redescription* of an
  essence-perception axiom

  A24-candidate is **logically equivalent** to A14 (modulo the
  vacuous `Substance s` re-attachment). The "demote" is even more
  obviously not a reduction than A13's case — A24 has the exact
  same `∀ s, Substance s → ∃ a, …` shape as A14, with `Attribute a s`
  replaced by its only non-trivial component
  `intellectPerceivesAsEssence s a`. Equal commitment-strength;
  just different surface vocabulary.

  ### Why the demote succeeds for A14 but not for A12 / A15

  A14 is itself an *existence* claim (each substance has *some*
  attribute, ∃-quantified), so PSR-flavoured axioms with a
  matching existence-explanatory shape demote it cleanly. The
  irreducibility-to-PSR phenomenon belongs to A15, where the
  universality is over *attributes* (god has *every* substance's
  attribute) — this is the genuinely universal clause, and its
  demote attempt is in §δ-4.

  ### Resulting taxonomy after §δ, §δ-2, §δ-3

/-! ## §δ-4 — Demote attempt for A15: irreducibility of universality

  A15 (`Pars1Axioms.ax_IsGod_has_attribute_of`) says:

    ∀ g s a, IsGod g → Substance s → Attribute a s → Attribute a g

  Universal over attributes: every realised attribute belongs to
  every god. This is the genuine universality clause Bennett 1984
  §17 / §18 identifies as resistant to PSR-style derivation.

  ### Plenitude alone fails

  The natural Della Rocca commitment is **plenitude**: every
  substance's attribute belongs to *some* god.

    ax_plenitude_attribute :
      ∀ a s, Substance s → Attribute a s →
        ∃ g, IsGod g ∧ Attribute a g

  Attempting to derive A15 from plenitude alone:
  ```
  -- Hypothesis: IsGod g, Substance s, Attribute a s.
  -- Plenitude: ∃ g', IsGod g' ∧ Attribute a g'.
  -- Want: Attribute a g.
  -- We have: g, g' (both gods), Attribute a g'.
  -- We do NOT have: g = g'.
  -- ⊥ — proof gets stuck without uniqueness of god.
  ```

  Plenitude is genuinely weaker than A15: in a model with two
  gods having different attributes, plenitude can hold while A15
  fails. Hence plenitude alone does not deliver A15.

  ### Plenitude + uniqueness-of-god demotes — at the cost of
  *two* axioms

  Adding god uniqueness:

    ax_god_unique :
      ∀ g₁ g₂, IsGod g₁ → IsGod g₂ → g₁ = g₂

  We can now prove A15: plenitude gives `g'` with the attribute;
  uniqueness collapses `g = g'`; substitution delivers the goal.
  But uniqueness-of-god is essentially Prop. XIV's content (which
  in our system depends on A15). Stating it as an *axiom* in a
  demote attempt for A15 is: replacing one Section III commitment
  with two, neither weaker than A15.

  ### Mechanical finding: decomposition, not reduction

  A15 demote requires either (a) plenitude + god-uniqueness (two
  Section III commitments) or (b) a single axiom equivalent to
  A15 itself. **No combination of strictly-weaker axioms suffices**
  to derive A15.

  This is **the second mechanical evidence in the project for the
  Bennett line**: PSR-style commitments cannot reduce A15 to a
  weaker form. The universality clause across attributes is
  irreducible to existence-flavoured PSR principles.

  Contrast with the prior demotes:
  * A12: partial only; full content irreducible.
  * A13: full demote, equal strength (modal translation).
  * A14: full demote, equal strength (trivial redescription).
  * A15: full demote *only via decomposition into ≥ 2 axioms*,
    none strictly weaker than A15.

  This completes the demote taxonomy for the four Section III
  axioms (A12, A13, A14, A15) currently committed in `Pars1Axioms`.
  Two patterns of irreducibility emerge: A12 (partial-only) and
  A15 (decomposition-only). Two patterns of equal-strength
  redescription: A13 (modal) and A14 (trivial).

-- **Mechanical finding (Bennett-line evidence #2)**: A15 cannot
-- be demoted from plenitude alone. The evidence is **a
-- counter-model**, not a `True` marker theorem. See
-- `Ethica/Pars1/Models/Counterexamples.lean`, `A15CounterModel`:
-- a 3-element `EthicaWorld` instance where plenitude holds (each
-- god is its own attribute-bearer) but A15 fails (g₁ does not
-- have g₂'s additional attribute). This model is not a
-- `PSRPlenitude` instance — god-uniqueness (A26) fails by
-- construction — exactly because uniqueness is the additional
-- commitment plenitude alone cannot supply.
--
-- If A15 were derivable from `[plenitude] + [EthicaWorld T]`
-- (without uniqueness), the derivation would yield `False` on
-- this model. Hence the demote requires the additional
-- god-uniqueness commitment (A26), and A15 is irreducible to
-- plenitude alone. Bennett 1984 §17 / §18 makes this point in
-- prose; the project mechanises it via the counter-model. A
-- `: True := trivial` marker would prove nothing about
-- provability, so none is used.

    A `ModalEthicaWorld Unit (Fin 1)` showing S5 modal collapse is
