## What this is

A formal-verification port of Baruch Spinoza's *Ethica Ordine
Geometrico Demonstrata* (1677) into the Lean 4 theorem prover.

Spinoza wrote the *Ethica* "more geometrico" — in the form of
Euclid's *Elements*, with definitions, axioms, propositions, and
demonstrations. He intended his metaphysics to be checked the way
a geometer checks a construction. This repository executes that
intention against a modern dependent-type-theory kernel.

## Methodology summary

### Three layers

The base layer is classical first-order with primitive predicates
over a `Thing` universe. The modal layer adds S5 with `□` for
"necessary by virtue of essence" and re-derives the same
propositions through Kripke-frame machinery. A categorical layer
(topos / monoidal-closed-category formulation) is planned.

### Section sub-categorisation of auxiliary axioms

Beyond Spinoza's stated A1–A7, the Pars I formalisation requires
auxiliary axioms grouped into three sections:

- **Section I** — definitional bridges making explicit the
  ontological/conceptual co-extensions Spinoza uses without
  comment.
- **Section II** — substantive promotions of stated content into
  forms the kernel can use (e.g. excluded middle on `inItself`,
  bridges between `Cause` and `intelligibleThrough`).
- **Section III** — metaphysical commitments needed to fill gaps
  in Spinoza's *demonstrationes*, partitioned further into base
  axioms (§III.A), demote candidates (§III.B), and modal-layer
  promotions (§III.C).

The sub-categorisation makes commitment cost visible to readers
and supports the demote-experiment methodology described next.

### Demote experiments

For each Section III axiom A, the formalisation can be queried:
*does some weaker commitment Σ derive A from the base layer?*
The procedure declares Σ as a typeclass extending `EthicaWorld`,
attempts a direct proof of A from Σ-augmented base, and on
failure constructs a counter-model in `Models/Counterexamples.lean`
falsifying A while satisfying all of `EthicaWorld + Σ`. The
non-derivation argument runs at kernel level: any Lean derivation
of A from Σ would specialise to the model, contradicting the
constructed falsification.

Outcome patterns observed across Pars I's four demotable Section
III axioms (A12, A13, A14, A15):

| Axiom | Demote Σ | Outcome |
|-------|----------|---------|
| A12 | `PSRSubstance` | Partial reduction; full irreducible |
| A13 | `PSRSelfCause` modulo bridge A18 | Equal-strength translation |
| A14 | `PSREssencePerception` | Trivial redescription |
| A15 | `PSRPlenitude` (plenitude + uniqueness) | Decomposition only |

Universality clauses (A12, A15) resist Della-Rocca-flavoured
PSR-driven reduction; existence clauses (A13, A14) translate at
equal strength. The structural distinction is not made explicit
by the prose commentary on Spinoza and is the subject of the
companion paper.

### Gap policy

Each `sorry` carries a `-- GAP-N` comment and an entry in
[upstream gap register](https://github.com/Nakammura/spinoza-ethica-lean/blob/6d4c0461265e50a3bbedb640fe60d9ad292b50a7/docs/gaps.md) recording the philosophical reason
and resolution path. Discharge happens in a dedicated commit that
updates `gaps.md` in the same change. Silent `sorry` is forbidden.

## Companion paper

The `papers/cluster_a_irreducibility/` directory contains a
research paper situating the formalisation in the
Bennett–Della-Rocca debate over Spinoza's Proposition V. The
paper provides the first machine-checked evidence in the debate,
encoding Bennett's reading of Spinoza's stated axioms as a
typeclass and Della-Rocca's substantive PSR as an extension class,
and establishing kernel-level non-derivability through
counter-models for A12 and A15.
