  Spinoza, *Ethica* Pars I — Causation layer.

  This module promotes A4 from its `True` placeholder in
  `Axioms.lean` to substantive form, by introducing the primitive
  relation `Cause : Thing → Thing → Prop` and an "intelligibility
  through" relation `intelligibleThrough`.

  A3 — Spinoza's *ontological-necessitation* axiom — is left as a
  placeholder at this layer (see GAP-7 in `docs/gaps.md`); its proper
  modal form ("∀ world, cause exists → effect exists") awaits the
  modal layer.

  A5 (substantive form) is restricted to *substances* below. Without
  this restriction, the Della Rocca closure of GAP-2 (which makes
  `sameNature` derived from `Attribute`, hence substance-only) would
  collectively force `¬ Cause m₁ m₂` for any pair of modes — wiping
  out the finite-mode causation Pars II–V depend on. Restricting A5
  to substances is the soundness fix that avoids this.

  Latin (recap):
    A3. Ex data causa determinata necessario sequitur effectus, et
        contra, si nulla detur determinata causa, impossibile est ut
        effectus sequatur.
    A4. Effectus cognitio a cognitione causae dependet et eandem
        involvit.
    A5. Quae nihil commune cum se invicem habent, etiam per se
        invicem intelligi non possunt, sive conceptus unius alterius
        conceptum non involvit.

  Reading: Spinoza's epistemology is causal-rationalist. To know an
  effect *just is* to know it through its cause; to be intelligible
  through `y` is to stand in a conceptual dependency on `y`. Prop. III
  ("things with nothing in common cannot be cause of each other")
  drops out of A4 + A5(restricted) once both are stated substantively.

/-- Substantive axiomatic backbone for the causal layer.

    `CausalAxioms` extends `Pars1Axioms`: any `EthicaWorld` committed
    to Spinoza's causal-epistemic axioms must also satisfy the
    base-layer axioms. This avoids forcing downstream theorems to
    juggle two typeclass instances.

    Only `ax4_effectIntelligibleThroughCause` is carried as a field:
    a separate `ax3_causeGroundsIntelligibility` field would have a
    *literally identical* signature, so it is omitted. A3's
    ontological-necessitation content (distinct from A4's epistemic
    content) is tracked as GAP-7 and awaits the modal layer. -/
class CausalAxioms (Thing : Type u) [CausalWorld Thing]
    extends Pars1Axioms Thing : Prop where
  /-- A4 (substantive): knowledge of an effect involves knowledge of
      its cause. The mechanised form: if `c` causes `e`, then any
      account of `e` runs through `c` — i.e. `e` is intelligible
      through `c`. -/
  ax4_effectIntelligibleThroughCause :
    ∀ c e : Thing, Cause c e → intelligibleThrough e c

  /-- A5 (substantive, causal form, *substance-restricted*): two
      substances with no shared nature are not intelligible through
      one another.

      The substance-restriction is a soundness requirement: with
      `sameNature` derived as
      `∃ a, Attribute a x ∧ Attribute a y` (GAP-2 path b), the
      substance-implicit nature of `sameNature` would, without this
      restriction, render `¬ Cause m₁ m₂` provable for every pair of
      modes — collapsing the Pars II/III machinery. Restricting A5 to
      substances cleanly preserves Prop. III's substance-side use
      while leaving mode-causation unconstrained at this layer. The
      fully general form awaits the modal layer's `hasAttribute`. -/

/-! ## Propositio III — substantive form

  Latin: *Quae res nihil commune inter se habent, earum una alterius
         causa esse non potest.*
  Elwes: "Things which have nothing in common cannot be one the
          cause of the other."

  Demonstration: *Si nihil inter se commune habent, ergo (per Axiom 5)
  nec per se invicem possunt intelligi, adeoque (per Axiom 4) una
  alterius causa esse non potest.*

  Mechanisation: contrapositive. Suppose `x` causes `y`. Then by A4
  `y` is intelligible through `x`. But `¬ sameNature x y` (with both
  substances) blocks any such intelligibility by the substance-form
  of A5. Contradiction.

  The hypotheses now require both `x` and `y` to be substances —
  consistent with Spinoza's actual demonstration path through Prop. II,
  even though his Prop. III statement is in terms of "things"
  generally. The general form is recoverable at the modal layer. -/

    matches that reading. -/

/-! ## Propositio II — Spinoza-textual form (closes GAP-10)

  Latin: *Duae substantiae diversa attributa habentes nihil inter se
         commune habent.*
  Elwes: "Two substances, whose attributes are different, have
          nothing in common."

  Spinoza's *demonstratio*: *Patet etiam ex Def. III. Unaquaeque
  enim debet in se esse, et per se concipi, sive conceptus unius
  conceptum alterius non involvit.*

  The Della-Rocca form `prop_2_distinctSubstancesShareNothing`
  (in `Propositions.lean`) proves `¬ sameNature x y` from disjoint
  attributes by analytic unfolding of `sameNature`. The
  Spinoza-textual form below proves `¬ intelligibleThrough x y`
  from the same hypothesis, routing through A5ₛ — closer to the
  *demonstratio*'s appeal to Def. III + the conceptual-non-involvement
  language ("conceptus unius conceptum alterius non involvit").

  Both forms hold simultaneously; the equivalence is recorded as a
  small lemma below. Closes GAP-10. -/

/-- Prop. II — Spinoza-textual form.

    **Note on the proof routing**:
    this theorem is named "via Def. III" because A5ₛ — which the
    proof invokes — has a substance-restriction whose body unfolds
    to `inItself ∧ perSeConceived` (Def. III). Def. III is
    therefore *encapsulated* in A5ₛ's typing rather than visibly
    chained through the proof body. The truly Spinoza-textual
    demonstration would expand A5ₛ inline using Def. III's
    "conceptus non involvit" language; in the present project
    that expansion is folded into A5ₛ's substance hypotheses by
    the GAP-2 closure (Della-Rocca `sameNature` derivation). The
    name is kept for continuity with GAP-10's title; the proof
    is honest about what it actually consumes. -/

/-- The bridge between Prop. II's two readings — Della-Rocca form
    (`¬ sameNature`) and Spinoza-textual form
    (`¬ intelligibleThrough`) — *is* A5ₛ. This theorem is a
    **documentation alias** making that fact citable by name; it
    has no proof content beyond invoking
    `CausalAxioms.ax5_noCommonNoIntelligibility` (eta-equivalent
    re-statement). -/

    (x y : Thing) (hx : Substance x) (hy : Substance y) :

/-- Contrapositive of Prop. III: if `x` causes `y`, both substances,
    they must share a nature. Used by Prop. VI to extract the shared
    attribute from a hypothesised substance-causation.

    Uses `Classical.byContradiction` directly to keep the term-mode
    proof short. The `by_contra` tactic in Lean 4 core would also
    work and is preferred in tactic-mode contexts. -/
